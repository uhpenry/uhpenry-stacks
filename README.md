An open-source collection of recommended tech stacks for various development domains. This repo powers the stack suggestions in [Uhpenry](https://uhpenry.com), the platform that lets developers easily monetize their code, APIs, and projectsâ€”like Shopify but for devs.

Whether you're building in web, IoT, AI/ML, or emerging fields like quantum computing, these stacks provide battle-tested combos to kickstart your projects. Community-driven: Fork, PR, and expand!

## Why This Repo?
- **Discoverability**: Helps devs tag and filter projects in Uhpenry's marketplace.
- **Community Vetted**: Real-world stacks from active contributors.
- **Cross-Domain**: Covers 12+ domains to inspire hybrid builds (e.g., AI in robotics).
- **Open & Free**: Use it standalone or integrate with your tools.

## Domains and Stacks
We've organized stacks by domain, with examples including core tech, brief rationale, and a sample repo link for inspiration. Feel free to PR additions!
